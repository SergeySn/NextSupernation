# NextSupernation
The purpose of this project is to start a collaborative effort to guess what the next supernation might look like.
I'll start with writing my ideas, and hopefully other people would provide constructive criticism and share their ideas.


## Government Structure
The federal government governs only the shared resources, such as military, police, environment protection, immigration.
Private sector takes care of all the things that are not intrinsically shared, such as education, health care, etc.
The country is divided into states.  The land of each state was originally purchased by an entity (individual or a group).
The entity becomes the state government and sets the state law.  State sells or rents portions of its land to sub-entities.
Roads are owned by entities, and are payed by the tolls.


## Taxes
1. 1st time country entrance check fee.  New people coming into the country should pass the check.  Fingerprints are taken and retina scanned.  That data becomes a person's ID.
2. Land tax. (Federal and/or State?)

The weight of each citizen's vote is proportional to the amount of taxes he have payed.


## Regulations
There are very few regulations.
* No government health care.  People are free to decide how they want to be treated and by whom.
* No government education.  People are free to decide how they want to learn and who will teach their kids.
* All substances are legal.  If someone choose to hurt himself with drugs - he is free to do so.


## Prisons
Prisons are private and self-funded by the labor provided by inmates.
Inmates can choose in which prison they are detained.


## Humanitarian Help
Private charitable organizations take care of the people in need. 
People are free to decide to which charity to donate and how much.


## Theory
Efficiency of a system is inversely proportional to Owner-Manager Distance (O-M Distance).
For example, with high taxes, large portion of resources is managed bureaucrats, who don't report directly to the tax payers, thus the corruption would be high, 
and consequently the efficiency would be low.

## Banking System (or lack thereof)
Since money is not a country-shared resource, government doesn't regulate it.
Explanation: 
Money is I-owe-you (IOU) notes.  Anyone can issue an IOUs, whether hand-written on a napkin or printed on a fancy paper with copy protection.
It's up to the others to decide whether to accept those IOUs or not.
In the beginning, people would mostly rely on existing IOUs (currency from foreign governments, like dollar and euro).



## Transition
If an existing country decides to switch to NSN system, each person would be given a choice: switch, or stay with the old system.
Each person can switch anytime.  To switch back, you would have to retroactively pay the old taxes, which you avoided while being on the new system.
Nobody really would want to switch back, but this option would make the switch less scary, when you know you can switch back tomorrow.
